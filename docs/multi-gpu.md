# Multi-GPU Pipeline-Parallel

**Status:** Axis policy follows the [authoritative device-mesh
tracker](../.agent-progress/device-mesh-refactor-tracker.md). Current
loader behavior remains architecture-specific and is characterized by
`PAR-001`; this document does not claim that `CAP-001` is implemented or
that a cell is production-ready without its required physical evidence.
The memory budget, deployment recipes, and measured throughput below remain
useful operational notes.

## Why PP

hipfire on a single 24 GB card hits VRAM walls on:

- 27B at `--max-ctx ≥ 16K` with `kv_mode=asym3` (`AGENTS.md:356`)
- 35B-A3B at `--max-ctx ≥ 4K` with FP32 KV
- hypothetical 80B-A3B at any context

Pipeline-Parallel (PP) shards layers across N devices. Each device owns a contiguous "band"
of consecutive layers. The residual stream `s.x` flows through the bands sequentially: dev_0
runs layers `0..k1`, copies `s.x` to dev_1, dev_1 runs layers `k1..k2`, and so on. Final
`output_norm + lm_head` run on the last device (dev_last) — its `s.logits` is read by the
sampler in place.

**What PP gives you on 2× 24 GB:**
- Run 27B / 35B-A3B that don't fit on one card with extended context
- Unlock max_ctx on 27B beyond single-GPU OOM limits
- ~50-70% of single-GPU throughput on already-fitting models (sequential PP=2 is slower per token)

**What PP does NOT give you:**
- Faster multi-user serving — that's TP (tensor parallel), separate roadmap
- Speedup on models that already fit on one card

## Memory budget (per-card, PP=2)

Numbers below are **measured** on 2× Radeon RX 7900 XTX (gfx1100, 25.8 GiB VRAM
each) via `crates/hipfire-runtime/examples/pp2_vram_probe.rs` —
`hipMemGetInfo` deltas captured at each allocation stage
(`load_weights_multi`, `Qwen35ScratchSet`,
`KvCache::new_gpu_asym3_capped_multi`, `DeltaNetState`). Per-card columns
report the worst-of-two (the device that holds more — typically dev_last,
which carries `output_norm + lm_head`). `total` is the sum across both cards.

| Model | quant | n_layers | dim | KV mode | ctx | weights | KV/card | scratch+DN/card | total | per-card max | fits 24 GiB? |
|-------|-------|----------|-----|---------|-----|---------|---------|-----------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| qwen3.5:0.8b | mq4 | 24 | 1024 | asym3 | 4096 | 1.3 GB | 50 MB | 8 MB | 1.3 GB | 0.7 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:4b | mq4 | 32 | 2560 | asym3 | 4096 | 4.0 GB | 134 MB | 15 MB | 4.0 GB | 2.0 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:9b | mq4 | 32 | 4096 | asym3 | 4096 | 5.6 GB | 134 MB | 19 MB | 5.6 GB | 2.8 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:9b | mq4 | 32 | 4096 | asym3 | 16K | 6.2 GB | 436 MB | 46 MB | 6.2 GB | 3.1 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:9b | mq3 | 32 | 4096 | asym3 | 4096 | 4.4 GB | 134 MB | 19 MB | 4.4 GB | 2.2 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:27b *(via 3.6 proxy)* | mq4 | 64 | 5120 | asym3 | 4096 | 15.5 GB | 268 MB | 42 MB | 15.5 GB | 7.8 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:27b *(via 3.6 proxy)* | mq4 | 64 | 5120 | asym3 | 16K | 16.8 GB | 872 MB | 80 MB | 16.8 GB | 8.4 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:27b | mq3 | 64 | 5120 | asym3 | 4096 | 12.6 GB | 268 MB | 40 MB | 12.6 GB | 6.3 GB | yes |
| qwen3.5:27b | mq3 | 64 | 5120 | asym3 | 16K | 13.8 GB | 872 MB | 78 MB | 13.8 GB | 6.9 GB | yes |
| qwen3.6:35b-a3b | mq4 | 40 | 2048 | asym3 | 4096 | 23.5 GB | 103 MB | 21 MB | 23.5 GB | 11.8 GB | yes |
| (hypothetical) 80B-a3b | mq4 | 80 | 8192 | asym3 | 4096 | ~42 GB | ~250 MB | ~2 GB | ~44 GB | ~22 GB | estimate, tight |

Notes:
- `qwen3.5:27b mq4` rows use `qwen3.6:27b mq4` as a measurement proxy (same
  `n_layers=64`, `dim=5120`, `head_dim=256`, `n_kv_heads=4` — VRAM-equivalent).
  When `qwen3.5:27b mq4` lands as a downloadable artifact the rows can be
  re-measured directly.
- `qwen3.6:35b-a3b mq4` is the current-generation A3B; `qwen3.5:35b-a3b mq4`
  ships local-only with the same MoE shape — measurement carries over.
- The 80B row stays an estimate — no public artifact exists.
- "scratch+DN/card" combines `Qwen35ScratchSet::per_device[i]` (residual
  stream, attention/FFN scratch, flash partials, logits) and the
  `DeltaNetState` slice owned by that device's LA-layer band.

**Asymmetry under Variant 2 (lm_head on dev_last):**
- dev_0 carries `token_embd`
- dev_last carries `output_norm + lm_head`
- Layer count shifts by ±1 for `n_layers % 2 != 0` (uniform split formula
  `base + (i < rem ? 1 : 0)`)

Probed on this hardware: per-card max < 24 GiB at every measured shape. The
A3B model at 11.8 GB/card has the largest headroom consumer; everything
else stays under 8.5 GB/card with 4 K context, under 9 GB/card at 16 K.

To reproduce on your hardware:

```sh
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 cargo run --release --features deltanet \
    -p hipfire-runtime --example pp2_vram_probe -- \
    ~/.hipfire/models/qwen3.5-9b.mq4 4096
```

## Deployment recipes

The daemon takes a `pp` field in the load message (default `1` =
single-GPU, identical behavior to pre-PP code paths):

```sh
# Filter to the two 7900 XTX (drop the iGPU)
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 hipfire run qwen3.5:27b --max-ctx 16384 "Hi"

# Bypass the inherited `gemm_..._wmma_ksplit` non-determinism (k-split
# atomicAdd reduction varies by warp scheduling — see commit f54ca71
# and kernels/src/gemm_hfq4g256_residual_wmma_ksplit.hip:22). Required
# for byte-equivalent output across processes / pp configurations.
HIPFIRE_DETERMINISTIC=1 HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 hipfire run qwen3.5:9b "Hi"

# Override uniform-VRAM tolerance (default 2 GiB; arches must match)
HIPFIRE_UNIFORM_VRAM_TOLERANCE_GB=4 hipfire run qwen3.5:27b "Hi"
```

Direct daemon JSON (driving without the CLI):

```json
{"type":"load","model":".../qwen3.5-27b.mq4","params":{"max_seq":16384,"pp":2}}
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` | HIP runtime device filter (standard ROCm) |
| `HIPFIRE_DETERMINISTIC=1` | Force k2 WMMA reduction (no atomicAdd) — bit-identical across processes/pp configs at ~33% perf cost on small-batch decode |
| `HIPFIRE_UNIFORM_VRAM_TOLERANCE_GB=N` | Pre-flight VRAM-asymmetry tolerance for `Gpus::init_uniform` (default 2.0) |
| `HIPFIRE_PREFILL_BATCHED=0` | Disable batched WMMA prefill (per-token fallback). Diagnostic for ksplit non-det isolation |
| `HIPFIRE_PREFILL_MAX_BATCH=N` | Override per-chunk prefill batch (default `PREFILL_MAX_BATCH`); chunks > N split with peer-copy at boundary |
| `HIPFIRE_WO_WMMA_VARIANT={k2,ksplit,k4,…}` | Manual override of the wo-residual GEMM variant — see `dispatch.rs` auto-dispatch |

### Current axis policy

The loader's current behavior is architecture-specific; `PAR-001` records
that behavior and the policy below. `CAP-001` will provide consistent early
enforcement for planned and unsupported cells; it is not implemented here.

| Axis/cell | Current policy | Production gate or owner |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Plain Qwen PP/TP | Existing code; pending applicable physical proof | `HW-003` / `HW-006` |
| LLaMA PP | Existing code; physical proof pending | `HW-003` |
| LLaMA TP | Partial; narrow eligible-artifact support | `AXIS-001`, then `HW-006` for production closure |
| Qwen2/VibeThinker PP/TP | Planned; not currently supported | `AXIS-001`, then `HW-003` / `HW-006` |
| Qwen35 arch-resident PP | Partial; generation remains arch-resident | `GEN-001`, then `HW-004` |
| DeepSeek4 EP | Existing code; pending physical proof | `HW-001` |
| MiniMax EP | Existing code; pending physical proof | `HW-002` |
| Other planned PP/TP and MoE-EP cells | Current architecture-specific behavior remains under `PAR-001` characterization; consistent early planned/unsupported-cell enforcement belongs to `CAP-001` and the owning `AXIS-*`/`GEN-*` implementation | `AXIS-001`–`AXIS-004`, `GEN-001`, `PAR-002` |
| Dense `EP > 1` | Governed by existing architecture-specific refusal; no EP support claim | `CAP-001` will normalize to one effective replica before mesh/device/allocation/collective construction |
| `TP > 1` × `EP > 1` | Explicitly refused (COMP-001) | Out-of-scope decision recorded; see `.agent-progress/device-mesh-refactor-tracker.md` |

Each implemented cell requires its applicable named hardware gate (for
example, `HW-001`, `HW-002`, `HW-003`, `HW-004`, `HW-006`, or another gate
listed by its owner) before production status. Emulated parity and
allocation evidence never substitute for the applicable physical gate.

## Throughput baseline (gfx1100 × 2)

Measured on 2× Radeon RX 7900 XTX, ROCm 6.4.3, with
`HIPFIRE_DETERMINISTIC=1` (bit-equivalent pp=1 ↔ pp=2 output).

| Model | Prompt | pp=1 prefill | pp=2 prefill | pp=1 decode | pp=2 decode | pp=2/pp=1 decode |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 0.8B mq4 | 22 tok | 838 tok/s | 588 tok/s | 332 tok/s | 227 tok/s | 68% |
| 0.8B mq4 | 322 tok (chunked) | 6493 tok/s | 5490 tok/s | 315 tok/s | 212 tok/s | 67% |
| 35B-A3B mq4 (MoE) | 15 tok | 331 tok/s | 258 tok/s | 142 tok/s | 97 tok/s | 68% |

Current limitation: pp=2 decode is per-token, and
`forward_scratch_multi` launches each kernel per layer without graph
capture. Async stream/pipeline execution, per-band graph capture, and
pipelined prefill are not currently available.

## Current boundaries

- The axis table is a policy and current-behavior summary, not a claim that
  `CAP-001` has landed.
- Documented refusal guards for `pp > 1` with DFlash or CASK/TriAttention
  remain in force; this document does not broaden those paths.
- Current `pp > 1` Qwen35 loading bypasses VL detection and lacks explicit
  load-time refusal. This is not PP+VL support; `CAP-001` must turn it into
  an explicit admission error.
- Homogeneous arch only (`init_uniform` hard-fails on arch mismatch)
- Uniform layer split — `init_layers(per_device)` is the manual escape hatch;
  `init_vram_weighted` is stubbed.
- Per-token decode has no async stream pipeline or per-band graph capture.
- Pipelined prefill (chunk N+1 on dev_0 while chunk N processes on dev_1) is
  not yet available.

## Validation (Stage 9)

```sh
# Multi-GPU gate. Skips silently when fewer than 2 GPU visible.
./scripts/pp-gate.sh

# Just the parity smoke (no daemon end-to-end), faster
./scripts/pp-gate.sh --skip-end-to-end

# Underlying byte-equivalence example
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 cargo run --release --features deltanet \
    -p hipfire-runtime --example pp_parity_chatml -- \
    ~/.hipfire/models/qwen3.5-0.8b.mq4
```

The `pp-gate.sh` battery checks:
1. Per-token `forward_scratch_multi` ≡ `forward_scratch` bit-exact (pp_parity_chatml)
2. Daemon `pp=1` ≡ `pp=2` byte-identical with `HIPFIRE_DETERMINISTIC=1` (greedy ChatML)
3. DFlash + pp=2 refusal at load
4. CASK + pp=2 refusal at load

A pre-commit hook calls `pp-gate.sh` automatically when staged files
match the `multi_gpu|pp_|peer_access|pipeline|stages` hotspot regex.

## Verifying peer access on your hardware

```sh
rocm-smi --showtopo            # weights, hops, link types
rocm-smi --showtoponuma        # NUMA placement
rocm-smi --showtopoaccess      # peer accessibility matrix
```

A `True` in every cell of `--showtopoaccess` for the cards you plan to use means peer-access
should work. If not, hipfire falls back to host-staging via pinned buffers (slower but correct).

## Open questions (will be filled in as Stages land)

- DFlash + PP integration scope — pending maintainer guidance on issue #58
- Whether mixed-arch should be soft-warn or hard-fail — currently hard-fail
- API surface for `HIPFIRE_DEVICES` — current direction is logical IDs post-VISIBLE
